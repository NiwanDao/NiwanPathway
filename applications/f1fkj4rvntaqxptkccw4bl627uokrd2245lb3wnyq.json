    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Qihe Technology Co., Ltd., established in 2006, is primarily engaged in the production and sales of security monitoring, information system integration, satellite navigation positioning, vehicle-mounted terminals, and service center software. The company is positioned as a provider of integrated solutions and operational services for artificial intelligent transportation information applications and as a developer of cross-integration technologies for mobile data communication and satellite navigation positioning",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "Those would be the data involved in an AI-assisted driving system include: Sensor Dataï¼š information collected by cameras, radar, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), and ultrasonic sensors, capturing environmental factors such as road conditions, vehicles, and pedestrians. Vehicle Data: status information such as speed, steering angle, acceleration, braking, etc., which can be gathered through onboard sensors or vehicle interfaces.Also, the computer vision model data.",
    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "My Own Storage Infra",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "I will split and pack the source file using our program leverages lots to generate the CAR file",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "link: http://182.136.78.70:8088/CH03_002.bag.tar.gz",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[X] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Sporadic",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1.5 to 2 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3), Shipping hard drives",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "Hongkong: 2 copies. SP not decided yet\r\nSingapore: will update the SP later on.\r\nChengdu: f03083319",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
